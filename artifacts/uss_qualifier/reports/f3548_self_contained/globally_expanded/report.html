<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>This step examines whether any operational intents remain.  If any foreign (other than uss_qualifier-owned) operational intents remain, then this step's checks will fail.  If any uss_qualifier-owned operational intents remain, the checks for this step do not fail but instead we proceed to the next test case.  If the area is clear, we skip the next test case.</p>

<h3>5.4. uss_qualifier preparation test case</h3>

<h2>20. [S17] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference Access Control</h2>
<h3>20.1. Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>20.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>20.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least two separate flight intents in this resource, as it will use their extent
to create two operational intents references.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>20.2.2. dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 1 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>20.2.3. second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS is properly enforcing access control rules, and properly limits the actions of a client against
the resources exposed by the DSS.</p>
<p>The participant under test is responsible for providing this second set of credentials along the primary ones used in most other scenarios.</p>
<h5>20.2.3.1. Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, these credentials must be allowed to create, modify and delete operational intents on the DSS,
as well as querying operational intent references.</p>
<h6>20.2.3.1.1. Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>20.2.3.1.2. Separate subscription</h6>
<p>Note that the subscription (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and this scenario will fail if the second set of credentials belong to the same subscription as the main one.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by second_utm_auth in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>20.2.4. id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>20.3. Setup test case</h3>
<p>Makes sure that the DSS is in a clean and expected state before running the test, and that the passed resources work as required.</p>
<p>The setup will create two separate operational intent references: one for each set of the available credentials.</p>
<h4>20.3.1. Ensure clean workspace test step</h4>

<p>This scenario is able to remove any operational intent reference that belongs to the configured credentials, but it cannot remove references
that belong to other credentials.</p>
<p>A regular failure of this check indicates that other scenarios might not properly clean up their resources, or that the <em>Prepare Flight Planners</em>
scenario should be moved in front of the present one.</p>

<p>This test step ensures that an operation intent reference created with the main credentials is available for the main test case.</p>
<p>To verify that the second credentials are valid, it will also create an operational intent reference with those credentials.</p>
<h5>20.3.2.1. 🛑 Can create an operational intent with valid credentials check</h5>

<h2>37. [S33] ASTM SCD DSS: Interfaces authentication</h2>
<h3>37.1. Overview</h3>
<p>Ensures that a DSS properly authenticates requests to all its endpoints.</p>
<p>Note that this does not cover authorization.</p>
<h3>37.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>37.2.1. dss</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/resources/astm/f3548/v21/dss.py"><code>DSSInstanceResource</code></a> to be tested in this scenario.</p>
<p>Note that to benefit from the maximum coverage, the DSS' AuthAdapterResource must be able to obtain credentials
for multiple scopes (so that a wrong scope may be used in place of the correct one) as well as an empty scope
(that is, provide credentials where the scope is an empty string).</p>
<p>This scenario will check for the scope's availability and transparently ignore checks that can't be conducted.</p>
<p>At least one of the following scopes needs to be available for this scenario to at least partially run:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
<li><code>utm.availability_arbitration</code></li>
<li><code>utm.constraint_management</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to verify each endpoint group, all scopes above must be available.</p>
<p>Optional scopes that will allow the scenario to provide additional coverage:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;&quot;</code> (empty string)</li>
</ul>

<h2>40. [S36] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference Access Control</h2>
<h3>40.1. Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>40.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>40.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least two separate flight intents in this resource, as it will use their extent
to create two operational intents references.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>40.2.2. dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 2 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>40.2.3. second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS is properly enforcing access control rules, and properly limits the actions of a client against
the resources exposed by the DSS.</p>
<p>The participant under test is responsible for providing this second set of credentials along the primary ones used in most other scenarios.</p>
<h5>40.2.3.1. Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, these credentials must be allowed to create, modify and delete operational intents on the DSS,
as well as querying operational intent references.</p>
<h6>40.2.3.1.1. Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>40.2.3.1.2. Separate subscription</h6>
<p>Note that the subscription (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and this scenario will fail if the second set of credentials belong to the same subscription as the main one.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by second_utm_auth in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>40.2.4. id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>40.3. Setup test case</h3>
<p>Makes sure that the DSS is in a clean and expected state before running the test, and that the passed resources work as required.</p>
<p>The setup will create two separate operational intent references: one for each set of the available credentials.</p>
<h4>40.3.1. Ensure clean workspace test step</h4>
<h5>40.3.1.1. Clean any existing OIRs</h5>
<p>Ensure a clean workspace for testing interactions with a DSS by removing any operational intent references from the DSS that may have been left behind from testing efforts.</p>

<p>This scenario is able to remove any operational intent reference that belongs to the configured credentials, but it cannot remove references
that belong to other credentials.</p>
<p>A regular failure of this check indicates that other scenarios might not properly clean up their resources, or that the <em>Prepare Flight Planners</em>
scenario should be moved in front of the present one.</p>

<p>This test step ensures that an operation intent reference created with the main credentials is available for the main test case.</p>
<p>To verify that the second credentials are valid, it will also create an operational intent reference with those credentials.</p>
<h5>40.3.2.1. 🛑 Can create an operational intent with valid credentials check</h5>

<p>✅ Provided by planning_area in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>42.2.5. second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS properly synchronizes the manager of a subscription to other DSS instances.</p>
<p>The test designer should provide this second set of credentials when full testing of manager synchronization behavior is desired.</p>
<h5>42.2.5.1. Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>Note that most checks in this scenario will work if the second set of credentials is not provided.</p>
<h6>42.2.5.1.1. Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>42.2.5.1.2. Separate subject</h6>
<p>Note that the subject (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and the depending checks will not be run if this is not the case.</p>

<h2>47. [S42] Solo happy path</h2>
<h3>47.1. Description</h3>
<p>This scenario performs a simple flight planning sequence with a single USS and no interactions with other USSs.  It
verifies that basic planning functionality for the USS works properly.</p>
<p>It assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance,
PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>47.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>47.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>The FlightIntentsResource must provide the following flight intents:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Flight intent ID</th>
    <th>Flight name</th>
    <th>Priority</th>
    <th>Airspace usage state</th>
    <th>UAS state</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>flight1_planned</code></td>
    <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
    <td rowspan="2">Any (but all the same)</td>
    <td>Planned</td>
    <td rowspan="2">Nominal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>flight1_activated</code></td>
    <td>InUse</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, the start times of all activated intents must be during the time
the test scenario is executed (not before). Additionally, their end times must leave sufficient time for the execution
of the test scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>47.2.2. tested_uss</h4>

<p>✅ Provided by instance 2 in flight_planners in top-level resource pool.</p>

<h5>47.3.1.2. 🛑 Area is clear of op intents check</h5>
<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<h2>50. [skipped] All actions from action generator</h2>
<p>This instance of this test scenario was skipped in this test run because: Test suite action to run ActionType.ActionGenerator action_generators.flight_planning.FlightPlannerCombinations could not find required resource ID &quot;priority_preemption_flights&quot; used to populate child resource ID &quot;priority_preemption_flights&quot;</p>
<h2>51. [S45] Nominal planning: not permitted conflict with equal priority</h2>
<h3>51.1. Description</h3>
<p>This test aims at testing the strategic coordination requirements that relate to the prioritization scenarios where
there exists a conflict with an equal priority flight that is not permitted by regulation:</p>

<p>It involves a tested USS and a control USS through which conflicting flights are injected.</p>
<p>This scenario skips execution and completes successfully at the setup case if a resource containing equal priority flight intents where conflicts are not allow is not provided, such as if a jurisdiction does not have any priority levels at which conflicts are not allowed.</p>
<p>It assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>

execution of this test.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the FlightIntentsResource must provide the following flight intents:</p>

<h5>51.3.1.1. 🛑 DSS responses check</h5>
<p>If the DSS fails to reply to a query concerning operational intent references in a given area, or fails to allow the deletion of
an operational intent from its own creator, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>

<h5>51.3.1.2. 🛑 Area is clear of op intents check</h5>
<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.  This test step verifies that the area is clear.</p>

<p>This scenario skips execution and completes successfully at the setup case if a resource containing equal priority flight intents where conflicts are not allow is not provided, such as if a jurisdiction does not have any priority levels at which conflicts are not allowed.</p>
<p>It assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>

<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<h4>52.8.3. Declare Flight 2 non-conforming test step</h4>
<p>The test driver instructs the control USS to declare Flight 2 as non-conforming. This makes non-conforming Flight 2 conflict with activated Flight 1 -- this same-priority conflict would not be allowed if Flight 2 were in a nominal state.</p>
<p>Do note that executing this test step requires the control USS to support the CMSA role. As such, if the USS rejects the
transition to non-conforming state, it will be assumed that the control USS does not support this role and the test
execution will stop without failing.</p>

<h5>53.3.1.1. 🛑 DSS responses check</h5>
<p>If the DSS fails to reply to a query concerning operational intent references in a given area, or fails to allow the deletion of
an operational intent from its own creator, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>

<h5>53.3.1.2. 🛑 Area is clear of op intents check</h5>
<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.  This test step verifies that the area is clear.</p>

execution will stop without failing.</p>
<h5>53.8.3.1. 🛑 Successful transition to non-conforming state check</h5>
<p>All flight intent data provided is correct, therefore it should have been
transitioned to non-conforming state by the USS
per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/interuss/automated_testing/flight_planning.md">interuss.automated_testing.flight_planning.ExpectedBehavior</a></strong>.
If the USS rejects the transition, this check will fail.
If the USS indicates that the operation is not supported, the USS does not support the CMSA role, and as such the scenario execution will stop without failing.</p>

<p>If the DSS fails to reply to a query concerning operational intent references in a given area, or fails to allow the deletion of
an operational intent from its own creator, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>

<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<h2>55. [S49] Data Validation of GET operational intents by USS</h2>
<h3>55.1. Description</h3>
<p>This test checks that the USS being tested validates the operational intents received as response to its GET request from another USS.
mock_uss plans an operation designed to be relevant to (but not intersect) the operation tested_uss will plan, and provides the data that tested_uss GETs.
tested_uss validates the GET response from mock_uss and accordingly plan its operation.</p>
<p>The primary requirement tested by this scenario is <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0035</a></strong> because a USS cannot verify its operational intent does not conflict when it cannot obtain valid details for that operational intent.</p>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>55.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>55.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource provides the two flight intents which must be relevant to each other, but must not intersect.
This can generally be accomplished when the convex hulls of the 2D footprints of the two flights intersect, but the polygons do not intersect.
There is an overlap in time and altitude of the two flights.</p>
<ul>
<li>flight_1</li>
<li>flight_2</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>55.2.2. mock_uss</h4>
<p>MockUSSResource that will be used for planning flights, controlling data shared for validation testing, and gathering interuss interactions from mock_uss.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by mock_uss in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>55.2.3. tested_uss</h4>
<p>FlightPlannerResource that will be used for the USS being tested for its data validation of operational intent.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 1 in flight_planners in top-level resource pool.</p>

USS about its operational intent to the subscribing USS in no more than MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification (5) seconds,
95 percent of the time.
To verify that notification was indeed sent for this check, waiting up to MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotificationSeconds gets us
95 percent confidence in declaring the USS non-compliant if notification is not received.
To ensure the notifications sent are not missed for a test case, we can pick a threshold that gives
a very high (e.g., 99 percent per test) confidence of non-compliance. We can make conservative assumptions
about the distribution of the delays. If we assume that the notification delays have a normal distribution
with 95 percentile at 5 seconds, then with the standard deviation of 3.04, we get the 99 percentile at 7.07 seconds.
Hence, for test cases that check notification sent for an operational intent, we will wait for notifications till threshold

<h6>55.3.4.2.1. Note</h6>
<p>As per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0085</a></strong>, MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification
is measured from time_start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS -
till time_end - Entity details sent to subscribing USS.
To make sure the test driver gives enough time for notifications to be received by mock_uss,
it marks the time to get interactions from mock_uss as - the time test driver initiates the plan.
The sequence of events is -</p>
<ol>
<li>Test driver initiates plan to tested_uss. t0</li>
<li>tested_uss shares the plan with DSS and receives DSS response. t_time_start.</li>
<li>tested_uss responds to test driver with Completed.</li>
<li>Test driver checks for shared operational_intent in DSS and checks its retrievable. t1</li>
<li>Test driver waits for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds.</li>
<li>Test driver retrieves interactions from mock_uss. t1 + MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</li>
<li>Test driver should find the notification in these interactions to declare that USS sent notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know from above that waiting from t_time_start for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds would
give us 99% confidence that we receive the notifications. But, test_driver doesn't have access to t_time_start.
So, it starts waiting from a point of time after the t_time_start that is t1.
This ensures that test driver waits for a long enough duration before getting the interactions. Hence, we get
a high confidence that the test driver correctly verifies if a notification was sent by tested_uss.</p>

<p>This page describes the content of a common test case where a valid user flight intent fails in a flight planner, because of invalid data shared for a nearby flight shared by another USS.  See <code>plan_flight_intent_expect_failed</code> in invalid_op_test_steps.py.</p>
<h6>55.4.2.1.1. 🛑 Plan should fail check</h6>
<p>A USS shouldn't go ahead and plan if it doesn't have accurate information.
As per SCD0035 a USS needs to verify a particular conflict status.
If flight intent data shared for a nearby flight shared is invalid, the USS can't successfully perform that verification.
It couldn't have obtained valid information about the other operational intents it's supposed to verify that conflict status against.
Therefore, the USS should fail an attempt to plan. If the plan succeeds, we know they've violated SCD0035 because they failed to verify that particular conflict status.</p>

<p>The test driver instructs tested_uss to plan flight 1. tested_uss should (per SCD0035) check if any conflicts with flight 2
which is of equal priority and came first.
The planning attempt should fail because tested_uss will be unable to obtain valid operational intent details for flight 2.</p>

<h2>56. [S50] Data Validation of GET operational intents by USS</h2>
<h3>56.1. Description</h3>
<p>This test checks that the USS being tested validates the operational intents received as response to its GET request from another USS.
mock_uss plans an operation designed to be relevant to (but not intersect) the operation tested_uss will plan, and provides the data that tested_uss GETs.
tested_uss validates the GET response from mock_uss and accordingly plan its operation.</p>
<p>The primary requirement tested by this scenario is <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0035</a></strong> because a USS cannot verify its operational intent does not conflict when it cannot obtain valid details for that operational intent.</p>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>56.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>56.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource provides the two flight intents which must be relevant to each other, but must not intersect.
This can generally be accomplished when the convex hulls of the 2D footprints of the two flights intersect, but the polygons do not intersect.

USS about its operational intent to the subscribing USS in no more than MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification (5) seconds,
95 percent of the time.
To verify that notification was indeed sent for this check, waiting up to MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotificationSeconds gets us
95 percent confidence in declaring the USS non-compliant if notification is not received.
To ensure the notifications sent are not missed for a test case, we can pick a threshold that gives
a very high (e.g., 99 percent per test) confidence of non-compliance. We can make conservative assumptions
about the distribution of the delays. If we assume that the notification delays have a normal distribution
with 95 percentile at 5 seconds, then with the standard deviation of 3.04, we get the 99 percentile at 7.07 seconds.
Hence, for test cases that check notification sent for an operational intent, we will wait for notifications till threshold

<h6>56.3.4.2.1. Note</h6>
<p>As per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0085</a></strong>, MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification
is measured from time_start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS -
till time_end - Entity details sent to subscribing USS.
To make sure the test driver gives enough time for notifications to be received by mock_uss,
it marks the time to get interactions from mock_uss as - the time test driver initiates the plan.
The sequence of events is -</p>
<ol>
<li>Test driver initiates plan to tested_uss. t0</li>
<li>tested_uss shares the plan with DSS and receives DSS response. t_time_start.</li>
<li>tested_uss responds to test driver with Completed.</li>
<li>Test driver checks for shared operational_intent in DSS and checks its retrievable. t1</li>
<li>Test driver waits for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds.</li>
<li>Test driver retrieves interactions from mock_uss. t1 + MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</li>
<li>Test driver should find the notification in these interactions to declare that USS sent notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know from above that waiting from t_time_start for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds would
give us 99% confidence that we receive the notifications. But, test_driver doesn't have access to t_time_start.
So, it starts waiting from a point of time after the t_time_start that is t1.
This ensures that test driver waits for a long enough duration before getting the interactions. Hence, we get
a high confidence that the test driver correctly verifies if a notification was sent by tested_uss.</p>

<p>This page describes the content of a common test case where a valid user flight intent fails in a flight planner, because of invalid data shared for a nearby flight shared by another USS.  See <code>plan_flight_intent_expect_failed</code> in invalid_op_test_steps.py.</p>
<h6>56.4.2.1.1. 🛑 Plan should fail check</h6>
<p>A USS shouldn't go ahead and plan if it doesn't have accurate information.
As per SCD0035 a USS needs to verify a particular conflict status.
If flight intent data shared for a nearby flight shared is invalid, the USS can't successfully perform that verification.
It couldn't have obtained valid information about the other operational intents it's supposed to verify that conflict status against.
Therefore, the USS should fail an attempt to plan. If the plan succeeds, we know they've violated SCD0035 because they failed to verify that particular conflict status.</p>

<p>The test driver instructs tested_uss to plan flight 1. tested_uss should (per SCD0035) check if any conflicts with flight 2

<h2>57. [S51] Awareness of relevant operational intents</h2>
<h3>57.1. Description</h3>
<p>When a USS submits an operational intent to DSS, a subscription is associated with that operational intent in DSS.
This subscription can be either an implicit or explicit subscription that covers the area of the operational intent.
The subscription helps the USS to be notified of new or modified operations in the area, when its operational intent is in
Activated, NonConforming and Contingent states. In this scenario, we will verify that USS under test has a subscription
to cover the operational intent area, and receives relevant notifications from other USSes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0080</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>57.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>57.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource that provides the following flight intents:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Flight intent ID</th>
        <th>Flight name</th>
        <th>State</th><!-- TODO: Update with usage_state and uas_state when new flight planning API is adopted -->
        <th>Must be relevant, but not intersecting</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_1_planned</code></td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
        <td>Accepted</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_1_activated</code></td>
        <td>Activated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_2_planned</code></td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 2</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Accepted</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_2_planned_modified</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>To reach a situation where Flight 1 and Flight 2 do not intersect but are relevant to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>their time ranges and altitudes do intersect;</li>
<li>their geometries do not intersect, but their convex hulls do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>

<h2>58. [S52] Awareness of relevant operational intents</h2>
<h3>58.1. Description</h3>
<p>When a USS submits an operational intent to DSS, a subscription is associated with that operational intent in DSS.
This subscription can be either an implicit or explicit subscription that covers the area of the operational intent.
The subscription helps the USS to be notified of new or modified operations in the area, when its operational intent is in
Activated, NonConforming and Contingent states. In this scenario, we will verify that USS under test has a subscription
to cover the operational intent area, and receives relevant notifications from other USSes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/6a92d389cc2b6f79ab69d05a25199efee7515df8/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0080</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>58.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>58.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource that provides the following flight intents:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Flight intent ID</th>
        <th>Flight name</th>
        <th>State</th><!-- TODO: Update with usage_state and uas_state when new flight planning API is adopted -->
        <th>Must be relevant, but not intersecting</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_1_planned</code></td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
        <td>Accepted</td>

        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_2_planned_modified</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>To reach a situation where Flight 1 and Flight 2 do not intersect but are relevant to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>their time ranges and altitudes do intersect;</li>
<li>their geometries do not intersect, but their convex hulls do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>
